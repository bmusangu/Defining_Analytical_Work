# Defining_Analytical_Work

## Client

Imagine that you are working with an organization that advocates on behalf of women in STEM. The organization has commissioned a report to better understand “analytical work,” and specifically whether there is a gender gap for analytical work in the labor force.

## Understanding the problem.

The first thing we want to do is understand the problem. In a real-world situation, the organization would provide specifications and further breakdown the problem however, there is no organization here. Therefore, for the sake of getting through with this task, let us pretend that the organization has described ``analytical work`` as any work in which you seek to draw a conclusion by use of some model. That is to say any field in which you have an idea and the task is to demonstrate through evidence that your idea is true or not.
Another term that we should seek to understand is ``gender gap``. In layman’s terms, it is the discrepancy in opportunities, status, etc., between men and women. In this case, it is a discrepancy in representation of women in analytical work.


## Task

1. Provid a working definition of analytical work.
2. To develop a working definition of ``analytical work``, will refer to the occupation-level characteristics collected in the [O*NET database](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html#all-files).
    -  The O*NET database is comprised of survey responses from experts and current employees about the requirements and responsibilities of each occupation.
3. Then use machine learning to assign a category or score to occupations by labeling a subset of occupations as “analytical” or not and predicting the rest. (e.g., pages 29-31 in this paper, which is doing a similar thing for predicting automation: “Future of Employment” by Frey and Osborne)
4. Explore how this characteristic is distributed across the work force by gender.
5. With a definition of "analytical work", we will use data from the [U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) which contains information about about the total employees across genders to explore the question of gender gap in analytical work.
